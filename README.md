It's time to buidl
My name is Grant Dever. I have prior experience coding in Python and Java but haven't build anything fun or useful in years. 
My plan is to build quite a few projects over the coming weeks and begin to solve problems with code.
Ideally, I will be able to turn more of my ideas into realities and eventually secure a role at the intersection of my interpersonal, communications skills and code.
